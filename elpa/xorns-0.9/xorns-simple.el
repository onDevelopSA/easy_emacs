If no grep process is active, find next error in occur buffer.

A prefix ARG specifies how many error messages to move; negative means move
back to previous error messages.  Just \\[universal-argument] as a prefix
means reparse the error message buffer and start at the first error.

The RESET argument specifies that we should restart from the beginning.

In the case of grep results, each visited buffer is marked read-only."
