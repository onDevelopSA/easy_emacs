;;; Commentary:

;; Include functions to change frame parameters and with the purpose of be
;; used easily in Emacs initialization processes.
;;
;; This module is not being used because is a better way to maximize
;; frames at its initialization (See `default-frame-alist' at
;; `xorns-startup.el').

;; Enjoy!
