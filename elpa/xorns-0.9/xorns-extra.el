;;; Commentary:

;; Define features that could be not desired from most members, but
;; do needed for particular ones.  These features are not include when
;; require `xorns', so this one feature (`xorns-extra') must be
;; explicitly required in one of `~/.emacs' or `~/.emacs.d/init.el'
;; files.
;;
;; To use `xorns', and automatically include all its basic features,
;; just configure one of the standard initialization files (`~/.emacs'
;; or `~/.emacs.d/init.el') with the following body::
;;
;;     (package-initialize)
;;     (require 'xorns)
;;
;; These extra features that are not included in basic `xorns'; to
;; configure in the selected initialization file::
;;
;;     (require 'xorns-extra)

;; Enjoy!
